    The cpb module gives you access to a binary representatin of selected
    columns in digital objects. Basically any data column (x,y axis)
    you can "preview" on the data portal (https://data.icos-cp.eu/portal/), is
    accessible from this module. You need to know the digital object ID's
    or have a sqparql query providing this information.
