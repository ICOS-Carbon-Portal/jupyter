## Structure
The notebooks, code files and ancillary data files are divided into projects. Every project has its own folder:

* **Drought 2018:** includes notebooks that use ICOS data to introduce students to basic principles of programming whilst exploring the consequences of the drought durng the summer of 2018.
* **Soil exercise:** contains notebook with a soil exercise for university students
* **Swedish Science Centers:** contains notebooks and ancillary data that quickly introduce the fundamental principles of Python programming by tackling climate change issues using data from satellites and/or ICOS stations. The notebooks are aimed to be used by visitors at the Swedish Science Centers or by high school students in the classroom.
