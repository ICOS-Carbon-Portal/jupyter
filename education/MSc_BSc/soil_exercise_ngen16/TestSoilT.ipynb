    "This is a test version of a Jupyter notebook to present some principles of diffusion of $CO_2$ in the soil. The exercise also introduces Jupyter Notebook as an working environment. This notebook combines (explaining) text with coding cells that contain the simulation model. Actually, notebooks can be used for data analysis and eg. shared between users to work together. Think that it can also be used to publish data analysis or to present a 'work-report' for an assignment (see an introduction to the use in [Shen, 2014](https://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261)).\n",

    "The background of the diffusion model of the production and transport of $CO_2$ is described in the exercise document. This notebooks goes stepwise through the simulation and presents the results in graphs. You can use it and for example change settings to see what the effect is in the resuls. As described in the exercise document, the notebooks presents three sub-sections: first the simulation of soil temperature, then the simulation of $CO_2$ production and finally the calculation of flux between the soil layers, the $CO_2$ concentration in each layer and the efflux of $CO_2$ out of the soil.\n"
