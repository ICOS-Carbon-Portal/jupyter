# FAQ

## Can I install a missing python package?
Yes. You can use pip to install a package into your personal account.
Open a new Python Notebook and issue the command !pip install myPackage. But please be aware, that if you collaborate with other people, the package is not available to them. If you think it is worthwhile to have this package/module for all users, drop us an email and we will consider the server side installation.
