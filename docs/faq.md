Yes. You can use pip to install a package into your personal account.
Open a new Python Notebook and issue the command `!pip install myPackage`. But please be aware, that if you collaborate with other people, the package is not available to them. If you think it is worthwhile to have this package/module for all users, drop us an email and we will consider the server side installation.
