# How to
This part includes some basic instructions on how to login to ICOS Jupyter Hub and start working on your first IPython Notebook. More in particular, you will learn how to:

- login to ICOS CP Jupyter Hub
- get familiar with the existing directory tree and available material
- create and work on your first IPython notebook

<br>
<br>

## Log-in to ICOS CP Jupyter Hub
Open your browser (Firefox or Chrome) and go to:

<center><b><font color="blue">jupyter.icos-cp.eu</font></b></center>

Enter your login-credentials in the popup window:

<b><u>Username:</b></u> [user_username]
<b><u>Password:</b></u> [user_password]

Note that if you wish to access our Jupyter Hub, you will first have to send us an email with your request to jupyter-info@icos-cp.eu. Once your request has been accepted, you will receive an email with log-in credentials to your account. In case you experience any problems with you log-in credentials, send us an email to jupyter-info@icos-cp.eu.

## Jupyter Hub directory tree and available material
Once you have successfully logged-in, you will see a list of directories.

*Common* includes all ICOS notebooks that are openly available through [https://exploredata.icos-cp.eu](https://exploredata.icos-cp.eu) (i.e. introduction-to-Python-notebooks, ICOS-notebooks, scientific notebooks and educational notebooks) as well as some additional code snippets. All notebooks that are stored in *common* are read-only, meaning that you may run the notebooks in there, but you cannot change them (no changes will be stored). In order to modify any of the aforementioned notebooks, you need to first download the notebook in question to your computer and then upload it again to the Jupyter Hub (instructions on how to download and upload a notebook are available below).

*Project* includes a list of folders with project names. You will only be able to see the project folders that you are associated with.

If you have worked with ICOS CP before, you will see one directory with notebooks running on Python 2.7 from a previous ICOS CP Jupyter Hub instance. The name of this directory is *jupyter*.

If you created any notebooks using the previous ICOS CP Jupyter Hub instance running Python 3.6, you will find those under the directory *jupyter3*.
