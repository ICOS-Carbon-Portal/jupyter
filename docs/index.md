## Overview
<img style="float: right; padding: 5px" src="img/jupyter_logo.png" width="75" align="right"/>
ICOS Carbon Portal is the data centre of ICOS ( [https://www.icos-cp.eu/](https://www.icos-cp.eu/) ) and is responsible for storing and disseminating ICOS data. ICOS Carbon Portal also offers a range of services towards researchers/scientists, policy makers and the general public. One part of these services is a Virtual Research Environment based on  Jupyter ([https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)) solutions.
 


## Jupyter

Jupyter is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) incorporating a collection of tools for interactive computing and sharing of computational ideas. From within every user account, it is possible to: 

- create directories
- upload data (e.g. csv, txt, netcdf, hdf, tiff, GeoTIFF, png, jpeg, etc.)
- create code files and write code (plain python code files (.py) or IPython notebook files (.ipynb))

Our service is based on the official Jupyter Dockerfile  [jupyter/datascience-notebook](http://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook) with kernels for Python, Julia and R available. Julia and R are 'out of the box' and we do not provide any support for these languages, for the time being, the  ICOS Carbon Portal **supports** only python solutions.

## IPython Notebooks
An IPython Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share interactive documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

## Access to notebooks and documentation
All openly available ICOS notebooks and supporting documentation can be found in the ICOS Carbon Portal Jupyter repository on GitHub [https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/](https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/).
