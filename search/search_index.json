This part is dedicated to presenting these notebook types as well as what purpose each one of them serves. The IPython notebooks available through ICOS Carbon Portal, can be divided into 4 categories: notebooks that help the user to get started with Python notebooks with interactive visualizations for exploring ICOS data scientific notebooks educational notebooks All aforementioned notebooks are usually open to the public. The only exception are the scientific notebooks. A scientific notebook can be private before a related article has been published or before a certain project is over. After that, if all contributors agree, the notebook can become publicly available through one of ICOS Carbon Portal's public Jupyter instances. Introductional The introductory notebooks are aimed for users that are new to programing or, on the contrary, are familiar with programming but in another programming language and wish to quickly learn the syntax of Python. The examples are custom tailored to reflect realistic ICOS use cases. These notebooks can be used by both researchers, educators and students. All examples are custom-tailored to use cases from the ICOS community. Explore ICOS data ICOS Carbon Portal provides notebooks to explore all available ICOS data products. These notebooks include interactive visualizations of ICOS data, that help the user get an overview of data availability, data quality and some statistics. Metadata of the station where the measurements were collected from as well as metadata for each separate measurement are made available through the interactive visualizations. It is for instance also possible to compare measurements from different stations. All plots include text with the citation of the plotted dataset. These notebooks are open access and are aimed for researchers, educators, students and the general public. Scientific Scientific notebooks are aimed for researchers and potentially policymakers. They include well-documented scientific methods applied over ICOS data or a combination of ICOS data and data from other sources. They are usually the result of a collaboration between a group of scientists working together with ICOS Carbon Portal on a research project or article. In this case, the notebook becomes publicly available only after the article has been published. Another possibility, is that the scientific community has requested a tool which then ICOS Carbon Portal has developed in close collaboration with experts in the field. Scientific notebooks include interactive elements that control the content of their visualizations. Visualizations can be static or interactive. Scientific notebooks are a way for scientists to help their work gain more visibility and, at the same time, a contribution to the scientific community, so that other scientists may benefit by using the developed code and potentially improve the implemented methods. Educational ICOS Carbon Portal in collaboration with researchers and pedagogues has developed educational notebooks aimed for high school students, university students and the general public. The notebooks developed for high school students and the general public serve as an introduction to environmental science and programming. The aim of these notebooks is to increase the awareness regarding issues related to climate change by using ICOS data. At the same time, they also introduce the user to basic principles of programming in Python and show why programming is necessary in environmental monitoring. Notebooks developed for university students include exercises focused on a certain scientific topic and programming. The notebooks are focusing on the application of certain methods and the critical assessment of the corresponding results. The code for the visualization of the results is often already been made available so that students may concentrate more on the scientific part without worrying too much about the programming part. Nevertheless, the option to dig deeper in to the implemented code is of course always there.","title":"ICOS Notebooks"},{"location":"icos_notebooks/#icos-carbon-portal-notebooks","text":"Just like ICOS Carbon Portal provides different Jupyter solutions for each one of the target user groups, it also provides different notebook types.

ICOS goal is to provide standardized, high quality, high precision, long-time observations of greenhouse gases to estimate the carbon balance of Europe. ICOS observations can also be used to monitor the effects of climate change and raise awareness on this global problem. As part of this effort, ICOS Carbon Portal provides a range of services to scientists, policy makers, educators, students and the general public. To make it easier for users to access, process and interact with ICOS data, ICOS Carbon Portal offers several alternative Jupyter solutions. There are implemented solutions that allow collaboration between scientists working on the same project, by sharing data and code. Additionally, there are solutions that address the need of scientists wanting to use ICOS data in combination with their own data. Finally, ICOS Carbon Portal has developed Jupyter solutions for promoting the data, metadata and role of ICOS to people who might not have any direct link to or prior knowledge of ICOS, like researchers, policy makers, educators, students or the general public. Jupyter Hub The Jupyter Hub is a service for registered users. It is aimed for researchers and research groups that make use of ICOS data as part of a funded project or as part of any other kind of collaboration. Every user receives an account and has the option to upload data, write code and create own directories. All work is saved. The user account is private and inaccessible to other users. However, if the user is part of a research group, there is the possibility of having shared directories between all members of that group. Members of the same research group can share code and data within the project group directory. Users that are not members of this research group, will not have access to the project-related directories. The Jupyter Hub runs in a Virtual Machine with docker containers. Jupyter Hub registered users run operations using ICOS CP resources. Exploredata Exploredata is a multiple purpose testing platform that is mainly used in presentations and short seminars. It is aimed for all target user groups, to test and discover the potential of IPython notebooks as a mean for presenting scientific output and visualizations of ICOS data. All notebooks on exploredata are open to the public. Exploredata is a Jupyter solution that requires log-in credentials and provides the same functionality as the Jupyter Hub, with the difference that no work is being stored. Every time a user logs in to exploredata a new Jupyter instance is created in a new docker container. The container is deleted after the user logs out or remains inactive for more than 15 minutes. Observe that exploredata can only host a limited number of users logged in at the same time. Temporary Jupyter Instances A temporary Jupyter instance can be used for a course, workshop or seminar. This type of solution offers the same functionalities as the Jupyter Hub. It supports multiple users who may or may not have shared directories, though every account is private. Users may upload their own data and create their own code files and directories. All work is stored. The only difference is that this Jupyter instance, including the content from all user accounts, is deleted after the course, workshop or seminar has ended. If users wish to save their work, then they have to download it before the instance is deleted. ICOS Carbon Portal has successfully used a temporary Jupyter instance for the purpose of a PhD-course, where all exercise material was made available in the form of IPython notebooks.","title":"Jupyter Solutions"},{"location":"jupyter_solutions/#icos-carbon-portal-jupyter-solutions","text":"ICOS data and metadata are stored on the ICOS Carbon Portal servers.
