The ICOS station network consists of about 150 stations all over Europe, subdivided into three sepparate domains; atmopshere, ecosystem and ocean. For more information about ICOS please visit https://www.icos-cp.eu/ . ICOS Carbon Portal is the data centre of ICOS and is responsible for storing and disseminating ICOS data. ICOS Carbon Portal also offers a range of services towards researchers/scientists, policy makers and the general public. One part of these services is based on Python-related products that are made available through various Jupyter solutions. Jupyter Jupyter is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) incorporating a collection of tools for interactive computing and sharing of computational ideas. A Jupyter VRE can host one or multiple user accounts. From within every user account, it is possible to: create directories upload data (e.g. csv, txt, netcdf, hdf, tiff, GeoTIFF, png, jpeg, etc.) create code files and write code (plain python code files (.py) or IPython notebook files (.ipynb)) Jupyter can support a wide range of programming languages (e.g. Python, Julia, R, Matlab, C++, C, etc.). At the moment, ICOS Carbon Portal supports solutions in Python. IPython Notebooks An IPython Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share interactive documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Access to notebooks and documentation You can find the openly available ICOS notebooks together with their corresponding ancillary data files and documentation on the ICOS Carbon Portal Jupyter repo on GitHub https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/jupyter .","title":"About"},{"location":"#icos-carbon-portal-jupyter-solutions","text":"","title":"ICOS Carbon Portal - Jupyter Solutions"},{"location":"#overview","text":"The Integrated Carbon Observation System, ICOS, is a European research infrastructure responsible for measuring, storing and disseminating standardised, high quality, long timeseries of observations on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as on carbon fluxes between the atmosphere, the earth and oceans.

ICOS goal is to provide standardized, high quality, high precision, long-time observations of greenhouse gases to estimate the carbon balance of Europe. ICOS observations can also be used to monitor the effects of climate change and raise awareness on this global problem. As part of this effort, ICOS Carbon Portal provides a range of services to scientists, policy makers, educators, students and the general public. To make it easier for users to access, process and interact with ICOS data, ICOS Carbon Portal offers several alternative Jupyter solutions. There are implemented solutions that allow collaboration between scientists working on the same project, by sharing data and code. Additionally, there are solutions that address the need of scientists wanting to use ICOS data in combination with their own data. Finally, ICOS Carbon Portal has developed Jupyter solutions for promoting the data, metadata and role of ICOS to people who might not have any direct link to or prior knowledge of ICOS, like researchers, policy makers, educators, students or the general public. Jupyter Hub The Jupyter Hub is a service for registered users. It is aimed for researchers and research groups that make use of ICOS data as part of a funded project or as part of any other kind of collaboration. Every user receives an account and has the option to upload data, write code and create own directories. All work is saved. The user account is private and inaccessible to other users. However, if the user is part of a research group, there is the possibility of having shared directories between all members of that group. Members of the same research group can share code and data within the project group directory. Users that are not members of this research group, will not have access to the project-related directories. The Jupyter Hub runs in a Virtual Machine with docker containers. Jupyter Hub registered users run operations using ICOS CP resources.
