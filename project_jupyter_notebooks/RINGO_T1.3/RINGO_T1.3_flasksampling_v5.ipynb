    "First in situ CO2 and CO measurements from five atmospheric ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) stations have been analysed together with footprint model runs conducted with the regional transport model STILT, to develop a dedicated strategy for flask sampling with an automated sampler. Flask sampling in ICOS has three different purposes: 1) Provide an independent quality control for in situ observations, 2) provide representative information on atmospheric components currently not monitored in situ at the stations, 3) collect samples for 14CO2 analysis that are significantly influenced by fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emission areas. Based on the existing data and experimental results obtained at the Heidelberg pilot station with a prototype flask sampler, we suggest that single flask samples should be collected regularly every 3rd day around noon/afternoon from the highest level of a tower station. Air samples shall be collected over one hour with equal temporal weighting to obtain a true hourly mean. At all stations studied, more than 50% of flasks to be collected around mid-day will likely be sampled during low ambient variability (<0.5 ppm standard deviation of one-minute values). Based on experimental tests, such flask data will be suitable to detect CO2 concentration biases larger than 0.1 ppm with a one-sigma confidence level between flask and in situ observations if about four flask comparisons would be averaged. In order to have a maximum chance to also sample ffCO2 emission areas, additional flasks need to be collected on all other days in the afternoon. Using the continuous in situ CO observations, the CO offset compared to an estimated background value must be determined the day after each flask sampling and, depending on this offset, a decision must be made if a flask shall be retained for 14CO2 analysis. It turned out that, based on existing data, ffCO2 events of more than 4-5 ppm will be very rare, particularly in summer. During the other seasons, events could be collected more frequently. The strategy developed in this project is currently being implemented at the ICOS stations.\n",
