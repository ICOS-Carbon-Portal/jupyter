    "### Flask sampling strategy\n",
    "The notebook is supporting the flask sampling strategy presented in the paper:\n",

    "Levin, I., Karstens, U., Eritt, M., Maier, F., Arnold, S., Rzesanke, D., Hammer, S., Ramonet, M., Vítková, G., Conil, S., Heliasz, M., Kubistin, D., and Lindauer, M.: A dedicated flask sampling strategy developed for Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) stations based on CO2 and CO measurements and Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) footprint modelling, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 11161–11180, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11161-2020, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "ICOS measurement time series of CO2 and CO can be explored to select an appropriate threshold of the CO offset (difference signal - background) as indicator for high fossil fuel CO2 events. The CO background is defined as lowest value in previous 3 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "STILT model results are available for selected stations only. In STILT the CO2 concentration is separated into contributions from regional fossil fuel emissions, from regional biospheric fluxes and from global fluxes. This allows  direct identification of high fossil fuel CO2 events and assessment of the CO offset as indicator for these events. STILT footprints are available for further analysis of the surface influence areas contributing to these events. The station footprints are combined with fossil fuel CO2 emissions from the EDGAR v4.3.2 emission inventory to visualize the influence areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ICOS release and NRT data is directly accessed from ICOS Carbon Portal\n",
    "    - Data for all stations currently available at ICOS CP are included\n",
    "    - Highest level at ICOS tower sites\n",
    "    - Selection of high fossil fuel CO2 events based on CO offset (difference signal - background) as indicator\n",
    "        - set threshold for CO offset 'highco'\n",
    "        - select sampling time, e.g. 13:00 local time (12 UTC) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test sampling strategy on 1-hourly STILT time series\n",
    "    - 1-hourly STILT results currently available for 2017 and 2018 at selected stations only\n",
    "    - Highest level at ICOS tower sites\n",
    "    - Selection of 'target' events\n",
    "        - select high fossil fuel CO2 events (only available in model results)\n",
    "            - set threshold 'high'\n",
    "        - select CO offset (difference signal - background) as indicator for high fossil fuel CO2 event\n",
    "            - set threshold for offset 'highco'\n",
