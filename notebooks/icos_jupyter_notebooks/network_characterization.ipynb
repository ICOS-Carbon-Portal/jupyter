    "For questions and feedback contact ida.storm@nateko.lu.se\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "ICOS currently has 13 member states and deploys almost 150 stations in the three domains atmosphere, ecosystem and ocean. Essential to monitor the net greenhouse gas balance of Europe and its immediate surroundings is to optimise the observation network to the evolving needs of science and policy makers. Providing the necessary information to further improve and develop models that answer the needs of these users is crucial. Extending the network to new member states and optimising the density in existing member states to fulfil these requirements can be assisted by network design tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the atmosphere domain the current ICOS network consists of 38 stations that monitor CO$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$, CO and in increasing cases also N$_{2}$O with high precision and accuracy, presenting an unprecedented dense network compared to the rest of the world. One of the main applications of the ICOS atmosphere observations is the use in regional inversion models. Inversion models, by combining observations, prior information and models, can be used to reduce the uncertainty on estimates of the net greenhouse gas fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolution and to distinguish contributions of different source and sink categories. Previous studies show that uncertainty in the atmospheric transport as well as the still existing regional gaps in the observation network are the determining factors that currently limit these inverse models. Future enhancement of methods and models and increasing high quality observations can reduce these limitations. The location for additional (ICOS-) stations needs to be carefully planned to create maximum impact on the models and enhancement of the existing network.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist the national networks in evaluating the current and possible atmospheric network configurations, the ICOS Carbon Portal has extended its STILT footprint service with a Jupyter notebook based tool. The tool allows the user to test any potential network configuration on its capability to capture the influence of sources and sinks. It does so by exploring the characteristics of combined influence (footprint) areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### User interface\n",
    "The user must specify what station footprints will be combined to form a “<ins>base network</ins>” and optionally a \"<ins>compare network</ins>\" which is an extension of the base network with one or several additional stations. In case of a network configuration including more than one station, the highest sensitivity value for each area (cell) in the STILT domain is used in the resulting network footprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “<ins>Percent footprint(s)</ins>” selection specifies what percentage of the average footprints of the stations in the network(s) should be used. For instance, if 60% is specified the cells that add up to 60% of the network's total sensitivty will be used. Consult the <a href= \"https://jupyter.icos-cp.eu/user/ida/notebooks/project/stilt_notebooks/footprint_area_analysis/visualization_average_footprints.ipynb\" target=”blank”>visualize average footprint notebook</a>  to get a better understanding why this is used and how it will affect the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the option “<ins>Select current ICOS network</ins>” will add all ICOS atmospheric sstations within the STILT domain to the base network selection. The user can continue to modify the selections after checking this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Footprints for the individual stations, which are combined to form the network footprints, are averaged over a user-specified date range. If \"<ins>2018 average footprint(s)</ins>\" is checked, all 3-hourly STILT footprints for the year 2018 are averaged. Note that checking this option will clear any selected stations. Also, the dropdown lists with possible stations to analyse is then limited to the stations that have footprints for all of 2018 computed. If left unchecked, a date range must be selected in the section “<ins>Select date range and hour(s) for the footprint aggregation</ins>”. Note that <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">specifying a custom date range as opposed to 2018 average footprint(s) will increase the computation time. </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section concerning \"<ins>land cover and population breakdown within the network</ins>\", countries of interest can be selected. This will characterize the network sensitivities within the selected countries by combining the network footprint(s) with data on land cover (<a href= \"https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.921846\" target=”blank”>HILDA 2018</a>) and population (<a href= \"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/population-distribution-demography/geostat\" target=”blank”>GEOSTAT 2018</a>). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The network footprint(s) cell value distribution is visualized in a histogram and on a map. For better visualizations, the maximum is set to the value if the 99.9th percentile of non-zero footprint cells.  In case of a compare network, the base network maximum is based on the compare network to be able to comapre the resuilts. A map showing the differences between the base and compare networks is also displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next is a table showing the sensitivities of the networks to the different European countries contained within the STILT domain. The sensitivities are normalized by dividing by the country areas and filtered largest to smallest sensitivity per square kilometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output related to land cover and population breakdown within the network(s) will look slightly different depending on if a compare network is specified or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Base network only\n",
    "\n",
    "The first graph, “Sensitivity of network to countries split by land cover”, shows the relative network sensitivity to the selected countries. The sensitivities have in turn been split by the different land cover classes within the network footprint intersecting the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph(s) show the “Land cover within \\*selected country\\* vs. sensitivity of network split by land cover within \\*selected country\\*”. The percent breakdown of the different land cover classes within the country are displayed next to the percent breakdown within the network. It gives an idea of what land cover classes are over/underrepresented by the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final graph shows the “Sensitivities of the network to country populations”. The network footprint has been combined with population data to show the relative sensitivities of the network to populated areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compare network specified\n",
    "\n",
    "The first graph, “Sensitivities of networks to countries split by land cover”, shows the relative networks’ sensitivities of the selected countries. The sensitivities have in turn been split by the different land cover classes within the network footprints intersecting the country. The only difference compared to only having a base network is that for each country there are two bars in the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph(s) show the “Sensitivities of networks split by land cover within \\* the selected country \\*”. Each land cover category is represented by a bar. The bars are in turn split into base network sensitivity and added compare network sensitivity to each land cover class. There are tables next to the graphs which indicate the increase in sensitivity to the land cover classes thanks to the added stations in the compare network. Unlike when only a base network is specified, there are no comparisons to the land cover breakdowns within the countries. To get this, we suggest defining the compare network as a base network and re-run the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final graph shows the “Sensitivities of the networks to country populations”. The network footprints have been combined with population data to show the relative sensitivities of the networks to populated areas. There is one bar representing each selected country. The bars are split into base network sensitivity and added compare network sensitivity to population.\n",

    "##### How to interact with output plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh plots include tools to help the user interact with the plot. In the figure below the tools are presented at the right side of the plot. The user must activate a tool before using it. Active tools are highlighted with a blue bar at the left side of their corresponding icon (e.g. “hover” is the only activated tool in the example below). It is possible to change the status of a tool (activate/deactivate) simply by clicking on it.\n",

    "<img src=\"network_characterization/screenshots_for_into_texts/example_bokeh.PNG\" width=\"700\" style=\"float:left\"><br clear=\"all\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of the most commonly used Bokeh tools with their description: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pan**: You can use this tool to move to different parts of the plot by panning (on touch devices) or left-dragging (on mouse devices). Tip: this tool might become handy if you have zoomed-in to an area that does not cover the entire area you initially intended to zoom-in to. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Box Zoom**: Draw a box over the plot area you wish to zoom-in to, by left-dragging your mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wheel Zoom**: Activate this tool to use scroll for zooming-in to areas of interest in the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reset**: Click on this tool to return the plot to its initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Save**: Click on this tool to save a copy of the plot (in PNG format) to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hover**: Hover over the plot’s contents to view pop-ups with information associated to every depicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user chooses to save the output, it will end up in a folder called \"<a href= \"../output\" target=”blank”>output</a>\" in the home directory. In the output folder there will be a subfolder called “network_characterization” once the tool has been run with \"<ins>Download output</ins>\" selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"settings file\" (settings.json) which specifies all the settings used to produce the output is also downloaded with the output. It can in turn be uploaded to replicate the run in the future by uploading it to the optional \"<ins>Load settings from file\"</ins> which is the last option in the tool.\n",

    "- \"Current selection\" must have at least one station. Use “Select stations for base network” to add stations to the selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"Select current ICOS network\" will load currently labelled ICOS atmospheric stations to your selection\n",
    "    \n",
    "- \"2018 aggregate footprints\" will declare the use of 2018 average footprints in the network creation. Many of these are pre-computed and choosing this option will greatly reduce computation time\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Unless checked a date range must be defined in \"Select date range and hour(s) of the day for footprint aggregation\". Note that if a valid date range is not selected the \"Run selection\" button will be disabled. This can happen if the start and end dates are the same.\n",
