The tool allows the user to test any potential network configuration on its capability to capture the influence of sources and sinks. It does so by exploring the characteristics of combined influence (footprint) areas. The resulting combined footprint of the user’s selection is displayed in three different types of maps including one that simply shows the combined footprint and two maps that are based on the absolute coverage of the footprints (referred to as “footprint masks”). In a next step, the footprint mask coverage is examined in terms of the extent to which it covers individual countries. The results are summarized in a table.',\n",

More in particular, With the combination of a station’s footprint (<a href='http://stilt-model.org/index.php/Main/HomePage' target='_blank'>STILT</a>) for a given point in time and a spatially and temporally resolved emissions database where emissions are separated by sector <a href='https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-959-2019' target='_blank'>(EDGAR v4.3.2)</a> it is possible to estimate what the fossil fuel component at the station could be according to the model. Accounting for the biogenic component through a combination of the footprint with a biogenic model <a href='https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GB002735' target='_blank'>(VPRM)</a> allows for an estimate of the CO2 concentration at the station when combined with the anthropogenic emissions plus a background (model edge) concentration. Given the modelled fossil fuel component and the modelled CO2 concentration, the estimated nuclear contamination, and the (measured) background ∆14C, an estimate can be made of what the ∆14C at a station would be according to the model -estimates. How this can be done is described in <a href='https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003GL018477' target='_blank'>Levin et al.,2003</a> (equation 3). The nuclear contamination is not accounted for here. ∆14C measurements can hence be compared to model deduced values. Uncertainties in the modelled ratio stem from many different sources: the transport model footprints, the anthropogenic and biogenic emission databases and the nuclear emissions values used to estimate the nuclear contamination.\",\n",
