    "There are several different isotopes of carbon, meaning carbon molecules with different neutron numbers. The most common is the stable 12C, \n",
    "which makes up about 98,9% of all the carbon molecules. Out of the non-stable carbon isotopes, a natural production and a long half-life of 14C \n",
    "(radiocarbon) makes the 14C to 12C ratio interesting for carbon dating. Carbon is replenished in the tissue as long as the organic object is \n",
    "alive. Once dead and buried\n",
    "with no oxidation, the exchange with the environment stops. At this point, the ratio will change at a known rate as 14C molecules have a half- life \n",
    "of 5730 years and its age can be solved for. <br><br>\n",
    "In this notebook the focus is on the 14C and 12C ratio in the atmosphere and how it can be used as a tracer to estimate the fossil fuel \n",
    "burnt in a measurement station’s influence area (footprint). From now on, this is referred to as ∆14C: the shift measured in per-mil from the standard ratio between the isotopes. In fossil fuels, all the 14C has decayed and burning it means an influx of 12C, which causes \n",
    "a negative shift in ∆14C.  This 14C depletion compared to clean background air  can be used to estimate how much fossil was \n",
    "likely burnt. However, there are a couple of additional factors to consider: \n",
    "- The background ∆14C needs to be accounted for. There is generally a small positive shift away from the standard ratio because of the influx of 14C from the atomic bomb tests in the last century. The ratio has since then levelled but there is still an ongoing small decrease. Measuring the ratio in what can be expected to be clean background air, such as at a mountain station far from emission\n",
    "sources, allow us to adjust for this before estimating the fossil fuel component. \n",
    "- There is a positive influx of 14C from nuclear facility emissions.  These nuclear 14C emissions can significantly contaminate the ∆14C measured at a station, if a facility is captured by the station’s footprint. To make a best estimate of the fossil fuel component this\n",
    "needs to be adjusted as well.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the combination of a station’s footprint (<a href=\"http://stilt-model.org/index.php/Main/HomePage\" target=\"_blank\">STILT</a>) for a given point in time and a spatially and temporally resolved emissions database where \n",
