    "### Background\n",
    "There are several different isotopes of carbon, meaning carbon atoms with different neutron numbers. The most common is the stable 12C, which makes up about 98,9% of all the carbon atoms. In the case of the radioactive carbon isotope 14C (radiocarbon), its natural production and long half-life make the 14C to 12C ratio an interesting carbon dating tool. Carbon is replenished in the tissue as long as the organic object is alive. Once dead and buried with no further exchange with the environment, the 14C/12C ratio of a sample will decrease at the known 14C decay rate (half-life of 14C=5700 years) and its age can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook the focus is on the 14C/C ratio in atmospheric CO2 and how it can be used as a tracer to estimate the fossil component of CO2 at a measurement station. From now on, the 14C/C ratio is referred to as ∆14C, i.e. the 14C/C deviation in per-mil from an internationally agreed standard ratio. In fossil fuels, all the original 14C has decayed during the long storage time. Burning fossil fuels like oil and natural gas thus produces CO2 that does not contain any 14C. An addition of fossil CO2 to an air sample (e.g. at a polluted station) thus causes a negative shift in ∆14C. This 14C depletion compared to clean background air can be used to estimate how much fossil CO2 is contained in the sample. However, there are a couple of additional factors to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The background ∆14C needs to be known. Due to an ongoing input of fossil CO2 into the global atmosphere, the 14C/C ratio in background CO2 is steadily decreasing. For Europe we measure a continental Δ14C background e.g. at the high-altitude station Jungfraujoch in the Swiss Alps. A maritime background can be measured e.g. at the Irish station Mace Head or at Izana on Tenerife Island (used in this notebook). Background air needs to be continuously monitored for estimating the fossil fuel CO2 component at a continental (ICOS) station.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>Update 2024-09-04:</mark> An updated version of maritime background at the Irish station Mace Head is used for the background ∆14C. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- European air can be contaminated by 14C emissions from nuclear facilities. These nuclear 14C emissions can significantly increase the ∆14C measured at a station, if a facility is located in the station’s footprint. To make a best estimate of the fossil fuel component this contamination needs to be calculated and the measured -Δ14C needs to be adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the combination of a station’s footprint (<a href=\"http://stilt-model.org/index.php/Main/HomePage\" target=\"_blank\">STILT</a>) for a given point in time and a spatially and temporally resolved emissions database where emissions are separated by sector <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-959-2019\" target=\"_blank\">(EDGAR v4.3.2)</a> it is possible to estimate what the fossil fuel component at the station could be according to the model. Accounting for the biogenic component through a combination of the footprint with a biogenic model <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GB002735\" target=\"_blank\">(VPRM)</a> allows for an estimate of the CO2 concentration at the station when combined with the anthropogenic emissions plus a background (model edge) concentration. Given the modelled fossil fuel component and the modelled CO2 concentration, the estimated nuclear contamination, and the (measured) background ∆14C, an estimate can be made of what the ∆14C at a station would be according to the model -estimates. How this can be done is described in <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003GL018477\" target=\"_blank\">Levin et al.,2003</a> (equation 3). The nuclear contamination is not accounted for here. ∆14C measurements can hence be compared to model deduced values. Uncertainties in the modelled ratio stem from many different sources: the transport model footprints, the anthropogenic and biogenic emission databases and the nuclear emissions values used to estimate the nuclear contamination.\n"
