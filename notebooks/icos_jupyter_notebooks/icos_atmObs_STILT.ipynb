    "This part presents the data availability of different data products. More in particular, it presents a table of available STILT model results for ICOS Atmospheric Stations. It should be noted that the content of the table is updated dyanmically. At present, STILT model results are only available for a subset of the existent ICOS Atmospheric Stations. The interactive table is colorcoded to mark the availability of any combination of ICOS Level-1 Atmospheric $CO_2$ Data, ICOS Level-2 Atmospheric $CO_2$ Data and STILT outputs. A legend with the marker symbols for every data category can be found below the table. The legend is interactive, allowing you to switch layers on and off, simply by clicking on a legend item. Use the *Box Zoom* and *Wheel Zoom* tools from the table toolbar (located at the right part of the table) to zoom-in or zoom-out in different parts of the table. Use the *Hover* tool to get more information regarding what year and what month a certain data product is available for. Note that in order to use a tool from the table toolbar, you have to activate it. A tool can be activated, simply by clicking on it. Active tools are highlighted with a blue line on the left part of their corresponding icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive map is also provided, depicting the location of all ICOS Atmospheric Stations. Zoom-in and zoom-out to get a good overview of the surrounding area of a station. Zoom-out to see which other ICOS stations are nearby. Click on the station markers to get more information about every station (e.g. station name, station PI, station country, station longitude, station latitude, available sampling heights, etc.). Click on the station name in the marker tooltip to be redirected to the corresponding station landing page o ICOS CP. From there it is possible to view and download all available data for that station.\n",
