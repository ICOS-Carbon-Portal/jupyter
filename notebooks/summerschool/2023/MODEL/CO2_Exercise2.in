 #--- DEFINITION OF SPECIES --------------------------
NAME       CO2
                                # --- The name of the tracer dispersed. It doesn't mean anything in particular, but is used for axis labels
MOLMASS    12.0
                                # --- (g/mole) note that mole mass is expressed in gram C (and not gram CO2)
START_CONCENTRATION 417e3
                                #--- START_CONCENTRATION is given in ppb (for example 'START_CONCENTRATION 368e3' means 368 ppm)
LIFE_TIME  -1
EMISSION LAND 9.49e12          #--- LIFE TIME in days; 'LIFE_TIME -1' means 'no loss'
 
 #--- Implement the emission command below according to exercise 6 in P01c_MOGUNTIA_CO2.ipynb notebook.
   ... something with EMISSION LAND xxenn
                                # --- EMISSION is specified in molecules/cm2/s; Convert from 10 PgC/yr 
                                # 10 PgC/yr comes down to 10e15 gC / (12 g/mole) * 6.012e22 molecules/mole / 510.1e16 cm2 surface / 31104000 seconds/year times 3, because only 1/3rd of the earth's surface is covered with land and we specify emissions from land.
                                # 10 PgC/yr = 3*5.017e38 molecules C / 510.1e16 cm2 / 31104000 seconds = 9.49e12 molecules/cm2/s
       
       
 #--- OUTPUT SPECIFICATION --------------------------       
STATION_OUTPUT MONTHLY
        # This tells Moguntia to output montly mean concentrations for the following stations:

STATION Mace_Head(53N,11W)                 53N  11W
STATION Trinidad_Head_California(41N,124W) 41N 124W
STATION Barbados(13N,59W)                  13N  59W
STATION Samoa(14S,171W)                    14S 171W
STATION Tasmania(41S,145E)                 41S 145E
        # Make sure there are spaces between STATION StationName lat and lon, but the StationName should not contain spaces.
        
OUTPUT  MONTHLY LATLON 1000HPA
        # This tells Moguntia to output concentration maps at the surface
OUTPUT  MONTHLY ZONAL_AVERAGE
        # This tells Moguntia to output zonal average concentrations every month.

 #--- A few rule for MOGUNTIA input files:
     - if a line starts with a space, MOGUNTIA will interpret it as a comment and not read it.
     - benefit from automatic highlighting comments by starting them with # (it will improve the readability of the input file)
     - make only small changes at the time, then try running MOGUNTIA. 
         If you do many changes at the same time, you won't know where you made a mistake.
     - keep the file organised.
     - you may add sampling stations, but be aware that the station name should be written entirely without spaces.
     - after changing the file, save it (File > Save in jupyter), reinitialise Moguntia, select the input file and run.
