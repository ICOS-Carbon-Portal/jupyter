 #--- A few rule for MOGUNTIA input files:
     - if a line starts with a space, MOGUNTIA will explain it as a comment and not read it.
     - benefit from automatic highlighting comments by starting them with # (it will improve the readability of the input file)
     - make only small changes at the time, then try running MOGUNTIA. 
         If you do many changes at the same time, you won't know where you made a mistake.
     - keep the file organised.
     - you may add sampling stations, but be aware that the station name should be written entirely without spaces.
     - after changing the file, save it (<CTRL> + S), reinitialise Moguntia, select the input file and run.
