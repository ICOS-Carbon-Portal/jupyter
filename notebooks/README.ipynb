    "* **Education:** includes notebooks that use ICOS data to introduce students to basic principles of climate science and programming \n",
    "* **ICOS Jupyter Notebooks:** contains notebooks processing and presenting ICOS data in interactive visualizations\n",
    "* **Introduction:** contains notebooks that quickly introduce the fundamental principles of Python programming\n",
    "* **Project-specific Jupyter Notebooks:** includes notebooks presenting the scientific output of projects ICOS has been part of\n",
    "* **pylib_examples:** includes notebooks with examples on how to you the icoscp library (i.e. Python library on how to get access to ICOS data)\n",
    "* **docs:** includes files for the online [ICOS Jupyter Solutions documentation](https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/).\n",
