    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simulate the growth in atmospheric mixing ratios of CO$_2$ as a result of fossil fuel emissions.\n",
    "* Compare the simulated growth rate to observed growth rates.\n",
    "* estimate what fraction of the emitted CO$_2$ stays in the atmosphere. \n",
    "* Separate the ocean and biosphere CO$_2$ uptake.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmospheric mixing ratio of CO$_2$ has been increasing from about 330 ppm in 1974 to about 400 ppm in 2015 (see figure 1). There is little doubt that the anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions that are related to fossil fuel use are responsible for the increase in atmospheric CO$_2$ mixing ratios. \n",
    "But what would be the increase in atmospheric burden if all the CO$_2$ would remain in the atmosphere? \n",
    "And what is the gradient between the Northern Hemisphere (most emissions) and the Southern hemisphere (less emissions)?\n",
    "To test this, CO$_2$ will be added to the MOGUNTIA model as an non-reactive tracer with only fossil fuel emissions. Other processes, such as uptake by the biosphere, oceans, and emission as a result of biomass burning, are initially ignored.\n",
