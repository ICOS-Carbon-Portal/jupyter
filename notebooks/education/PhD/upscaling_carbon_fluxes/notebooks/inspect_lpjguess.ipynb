To mimic local conditions, the model was forced with daily surface air temperature, precipitation and incoming shortwave radiation measured at the sites (for years 2015-2018), but inputs of nitrogen deposition and soil properties were taken from global datasets. In certain cases, the plant functional types and species that can establish in the model were restricted to match site conditions, but neither site management history nor disturbances were considered. Finally, no wetland features were activated.\n",
