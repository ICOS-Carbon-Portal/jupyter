# ICOS Carbon Portal - Jupyter Notebooks for Education at BSc and MSc level

This folder contains subfolders with educational material that has been developed for university students (bachelor's and master's students).

<br>

## Structure
The notebooks, code files and ancillary data files are divided into projects. Every project has its own folder:

* **drought_2018** includes notebooks that use ICOS data from the Hyltemossa station to introduce students to basic principles of programming while exploring the consequences of the drought during the summer of 2018.
* **soil_exercise_ngen16** contains a notebook with a soil exercise for university students.
