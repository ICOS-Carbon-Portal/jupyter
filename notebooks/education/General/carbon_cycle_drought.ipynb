    "### Programming exercises in Python using ICOS CO$_2$-data\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to explaining the carbon cycle and focuses on topics regarding daily and yearly fluctuations in the concentration and uptake of carbon dioxide. It contains definitions, short descriptions, figures and animations that describe the following terms: **carbon dioxide**, **carbon cycle**, **carbon sinks**, **carbon sources**, **photosynthesis** and **Gross Primary Production (GPP)**. You will be able to test your knowledge on carbon by taking the _Carbon Challenge Quiz_. In order to better comprehend the carbon cycle with real-life examples, the notebook also includes exercises using ICOS data from Hyltemossa research station in Sweden.\n",

    "Calculating statistics over several thousands of values by hand (i.e. using paper and pen) can be a cumbersome task. Not to mention the probability of committing en error in the calculations, which is getting higher as the number of values increases. Computer programming allows us to execute computations over large number of values faster and more accurately. The purpose of the following programming exercises is for you to gain first hand experience of how easy it is to calculate statistics, over relatively *large* datasets, using just a few lines of code. Several step-by-step exercises have been developed to make you acquainted with basic principles in Python-programming. \n",

    "-  Calculate statistics over the data values of an array/DataFrame\n",
    "-  Create static and interactive plots\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming exercises build on topics related to the daily and yearly patterns of uptake and release of carbon dioxide amongst different parts of an ecosystem. You will have the chance to test your newly acquired knowledge in  programming and climate science in the final exercise, where you will be asked to help a climate scientist determine whether the drought during the summer of 2018 had any effect on the vegetation near Hyltemossa research station.  \n",

    "## 1. What is carbon dioxide (CO$_2$)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Definition\n",
    "Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound that is composed of one carbon and two oxygen atoms. It is represented by the chemical formula: **CO$_2$**. In average temperature and pressure conditions, it appears as a colourless gas with a faint sharp odour and a sour taste [[1]](#references). Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere in a low concentration and acts as a heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas [[1]](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. How is CO$_2$ produced\n",
    "Carbon dioxide is released through human activities (e.g. burning fossil fuels, forest fires, deforestation, etc.) and natural processes (e.g. animal/plant respiration, fermentation and volcanic eruptions) [[2]](#references). At this point, it is important to state that the burning of biomass (i.e. the mass of biological organisms in an ecosystem at a given time) [[3]](#references) or carbon-containing materials does not necessarily lead to an increase of the carbon dioxide concentration in the Earth's atmosphere. This is true, as long as the biomass is allowed to grow back and absorb the same amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide as before. However, burning fossil fuels (such as coal, oil or gas) results in the release of carbon, that has been outside of the carbon cycle for a very long time, back into the atmosphere. When this carbon is not absorbed to produce new biomass (from processes like e.g. plant photosynthesis), then the total concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. CO$_2$ and the greenhouse effect\n",
    "Greenhouse gases like water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide or ozone are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere and allow incoming solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface. The incoming solar radiation is then absorbed by the land and the oceans, heating the Earth. As a result, heat is radiated from Earth to space. Some of this heat is then trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, keeping the Earth warm enough to sustain life (*greenhouse effect*) [[4]](#references). Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's temperature would be too low to sustain any form of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. CO$_2$ and the consequences of the enhanced greenhouse effect\n",
    "But what happens when the total concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere begins to increase? Increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere lead to more heat being trapped, which ultimately causes the temperatures on the Earth's surface to increase too (*enhanced greenhouse effect*) [[5]](#references). A direct consequence of this effect is global warming, which in turn, is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- thawing/melting glaciers and permafrost\n",
    "- rising sea levels\n",
    "- more frequently occurring extreme cases of precipitation or drought\n",
    "- changing conditions for agriculture due to\n",
    "    - desertification\n",
    "    - change in the start and/or duration of the growing season \n",
    "\n",
    "Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are also linked to ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is a process where the ocean's ph-levels are slowly decreasing, as it absorbs increasingly higher amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification reduces the amount of carbonate in oceans, which makes it more difficult for marine organisms like corals or plankton to build their shells or skeletons [[4]](#references). More acidic conditions may also dissolve existing shells and affect the metabolic functions, growth and reproduction of other marine life (e.g. fishes), ultimately disturbing the balance of the oceanic ecosystems. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Definition\n",
    "Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH$_4$) are all included in the carbon cycle. The figure below shows how different chemical compounds of carbon are being transported from carbon sources to carbon sinks. **Carbon sources** are processes that are responsible for emitting carbon to the atmosphere. On the contrary, processes that absorb carbon from the atmosphere are described as **carbon sinks**. In the figure, carbon sinks are represented by blue arrows while carbon sources are represented by pink arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Carbon sources\n",
    "Carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, is emitted to the atmosphere through human, animal and plant respiration. A large portion of carbon emissions to the atmosphere originate from burning fossil fuels. Forest fires are also responsible for emitting carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, to the atmosphere. Ocean animals and plants do also emit carbon dioxide through respiration. Grazing animals, and especially cows, emit methane by eructation (belching/burping) and/or flatulence (farting). Methane is also emitted by bacteria that can be found in human or animal faeces. Carbon dioxide and methane are emitted when detritivores/decomposers, like fungi or earthworms, decompose dead organic matter (e.g. twigs, leaves, animal parts, etc.) and turn it into soil. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Carbon sinks\n",
    "Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere, in the form of carbon dioxide, when they photosynthesize. The process during which plants absorb carbon dioxide, water and energy from the sun to produce oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds is denoted as **photosynthesis**. This process is performed by terrestrial, aquatic and ocean plants. Photosynthesis can only take place when sunlight is available. Therefore, plants do not photosynthesize during night. Instead, during night time, plants only respire (i.e. breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide). Plants store carbon in their tissue (biomass), when they use the energy-rich organic compounds that they produced during photosynthesis, to create new branches, leaves and roots or to expand the size of their trunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon enters the soil in the form of dead organic matter. All living organisms (e.g. plants, animals and humans) consist of organic matter. When plants drop their leaves or twigs on the ground, they drop organic matter. The same thing happens when humans and animals drop urine or faeces. In marine ecosystems, dead organic matter that has fallen down to the seabed, is turned into sediment. Carbon that is stored in soils can slowly be turned into oil and gas. However, this is a process that can take between 50 million to 500 million years to complete.\n",

    "The purpose of this part is to further introduce you to the patterns followed by the daily and annual cycle of carbon dioxide. To achieve this, you are going to calculate statistics over larger datasets of carbon dioxide concentration values from Hyltemossa research station for 2017 - 2019. You will visualize the time series by creating an interactive diagram and then use the tools provided to extract more information from the plotted values. Before you are able to calculate any statistics over the aforementioned values, you will have to import the corresponding datafile and store its content in an array. Python allows you to import data from a datafile and directly store it in an array, by using ready functions (code). In Python, these ready functions are called modules. A module has to be imported before it can be used. Sometimes it might be interesting to calculate statistics over shorter time-intervals than a year. Data that is stored in an Python array can be filtered in different ways. Here you will learn how to filter data by time and calculate statistics over subsets of data.\n",

    "Python is a programming language that includes built-in methods. A module can be described as set of functions. To use these functions, you need to first import the module they belong to. Usually, modules are imported in the beginning of a Python-program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next code-cell shows the syntax of how to import Python modules. It is possible to import a module using the syntax <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">import datetime</code>. To import all functions from a module type <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">from datetime import *</code>. However, this is considered bad practice, so it is best to avoid that. For importing a single function from a module type <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">from datetime import datetime</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import a module, it is possible to change its name after the keyword <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">as</code>. Usually, the name provided after <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">as</code> is an abbreviation of the modules official name. The following piece of code <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">import pandas as pd</code>, will import a module called _pandas_ and change its name to _pd_. This way, you do not have to type the full name of the module when you include it in your code. Your code will be easier to read if you decide to follow this practice, and will conform with most examples you will find for both _pandas (pd)_ and _numpy (np)_.\n",

    "\n",
    "Arrays are used in programming to store data in a structured way. An array consists of rows and columns. Python has different kinds of arrays. Here we are going to work with pandas DataFrames. This type of array allows you to store data with different data types in the same array (i.e., pandas DataFrame). It is, for example, permitted to store a column with datetime objects, a column with strings and a column with floats in the same DataFrame (see figure below).\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can refer to values in a pandas DataFrame by using their corresponding column name and row number. For example, the value *412.985* in the DataFrame above, belongs to the column *co2* and its row number is *2*. Note that, in Python, the numbering of rows begins with *0* instead of *1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Row numbers often serve as an index. An index is used to find and retrieve data. For now, it is OK to consider an index as one of the DataFrame's columns that contains unique vales. In the example above, the index is numeric and consists of a set of integers. Every row has a different number (i.e. every row is identified by a different number). An index does not have to be numeric but it should not include duplicates. Columns that contain datetime objects (e.g. *DateTime* column in the figure above) can also be used as an index. This is valid, as it is not possible for two different measurements to have been measured by the same instrument at the exact same timepoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we are going to explain the syntax of the code that is used to read data from csv-files and store it in pandas DataFrames. A csv-file is a text-file containing comma separated values. This type of file contains data that can be stored in arrays/DataFrames. Values in a csv-file are stored in as many rows as the rows included in its corresponding array/DataFrame. Values that belong to the same row but different columns, are separated by a \",\" (comma). Other characters (e.g. \";\") may also be used as delimiters (i.e. a character that separates values). Usually, the first row in a csv-file contains the column names.\n",

    "Python uses a built-in function <code style=\"color:#CD5C5C\">read_csv()</code> from the <i>pandas</i> module to read data from a csv-file and store it in a pandas DataFrame. Remember that, in this case, the <i>pandas</i> module was renamed to <i>pd</i> at import.\n",

    "During the summer of 2018, many places in Sweden experienced record high temperatures. It was also a summer with very little precipitation. When the air temperature gets too high and the soil too dry, many plants respond by limiting or stopping completely their photosynthetic activity (i.e. they stop growing). This is a survival mechanism, as plants tend to loose water during photosynthesis. Consequently, when water resources are scarce, plants focus on maintaining their existent biomass to survive and thus stop growing. When plants stop photosynthesizing, they also stop taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n",

    "Anna is a climate scientist and researcher. She wants to find out if the drought of the summer of 2018 had a negative effect on the vegetation near Hyltemossa research station. One way of discovering that, is to examine how much atmospheric carbon dioxide was taken up by the vegetation near Hyltemossa during that summer. In other words, this is an attempt to estimate how much plants photosynthesized during that summer. Gross Primary Production (GPP)  of an ecosystem can be described as the amount of carbon that has been taken up from the atmosphere by plants during photosynthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Martin, who is the principal Investigator (PI) responsible for running Hyltemossa station, has sent Anna a datafile with GPP-values covering the time period 2015 - 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anna was planning to plot these values and carry out a visual inspection, as a first attempt of spotting any differences in the uptake of CO$_2$ between 2018 and the previous years. She was also thinking of calculating the sum of the CO$_2$ uptake during the summer months of 2018 and comparing it to the corresponding sums of the previous years. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, Anna is very busy with fieldwork.\n",
    "Could you help her create the plot and perform the necessary computations?\n",
