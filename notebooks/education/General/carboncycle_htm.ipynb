It contains definitions, short descriptions, figures and animations that describe the following terms: **carbon dioxide**, **carbon cycle**, **carbon sinks** and **carbon sources**. You will be able to test your knowledge on carbon by taking the _Carbon Challenge Quiz_. In order to better comprehend the carbon cycle, the notebook also includes exercises using ICOS data from Hyltemossa station in Sweden. The exercises are based on topics related to the uptake and release of carbon dioxide amongst different parts of an ecosystem.\n",

    "## 1. What is carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Definition\n",
    "Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound that is composed of one carbon and two oxygen atoms. It is represented by the chemical formula: **CO$_2$**. In average temperature and pressure conditions, it appears as a colourless gas with a faint sharp odour and a sour taste [[1]](#references). Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere in a low concentration and acts as a heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas [[1]](#references). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. How is CO$_2$ produced\n",
    "Carbon dioxide is released through human activities (e.g. burning fossil fuels, forest fires, deforestation, etc.) and natural processes (e.g. animal/plant respiration, fermentation and volcanic eruptions) [[2]](#references). At this point, it is important to state that the burning of biomass (i.e. the mass of biological organisms in an ecosystem at a given time) [[3]](#references) or carbon-containing materials does not necessarily lead to an increase of the carbon dioxide concentration in the Earth's atmosphere. This is true, as long as the biomass is allowed to grow back and abosrb the same amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide as before. However, burning fossil fuels (such as coal, oil or gas) results in the release of carbon, that has been outside of the carbon cycle for a very long time, back into the atmosphere. When this carbon is not absorbed to produce new biomass (from processes like e.g. plantphotosynthesis), then the total concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. CO$_2$ and the greenhouse effect\n",
    "Greenhouse gases like water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide or ozone are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere and allow incoming solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere and reach the Earth's surface. The incoming solar radiation is then absorbed by the land and the oceans, heating the Earth. As a result, heat is radiated from Earth to space. Some of this heat is then trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, keeping the Earth warm enough to sustain life (*greenhouse effect*) [[4]](#references). Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's temperature would be too low to sustain any form of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. CO$_2$ and the consequences of the enhanced greenhouse effect\n",
    "But what happens when the total concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere begins to increase? Increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere lead to more heat being trapped, which ultimately causes the temperatures on the Earth's surface to increase too (*enhanced greenhouse effect*) [[5]](#references). A direct consequence of this effect is global warming, which in turn, is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- thawing/melting glaciers and permafrost\n",
    "- rising sea levels\n",
    "- more frequently occuring extreme cases of precipitation or drought\n",
    "- changing conditions for agriculture due to\n",
    "    - desertification\n",
    "    - change in the start and/or duration of the growing season \n",
    "\n",
    "Increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are also linked to ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is a process where the ocean's ph-levels are slowly decreasing, as it absorbs increasingly higher amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification reduces the amount of carbonate in oceans, which makes it more difficult for marine organisms like corals or plankton to build their shells and skeletons [[4]](#references). More acidic conditions may also dissolve existing shells and affect the metabolic functions, growth and reproduction of other marine life (e.g. fishes), ultimately disturbing the balance of the oceanic ecosystems. \n",

    "## 2. Carbon Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Definition\n",
    "Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH$_4$) are all included in the carbon cycle. The figure below shows how different chemical compounds of carbon are being transported from carbon sources to carbon sinks. **Carbon sources** are processes that are responsible for emitting carbon to the atmosphere. On the contrary, processes that absorb carbon from the atmosphere are described as **carbon sinks**. In the figure, carbon sinks are represented by blue arrows while carbon sources are represented by pink arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Carbon sources\n",
    "Carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, is emitted to the atmosphere through human, animal and plant respiration. A large portion of carbon emissions to the atmosphere originate from burning fossil fuels. Forest fires are also responsible for emitting carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, to the atmosphere. Ocean animals and plants do also emit carbon dioxide through respiration. Grazing animals, and especially cows, emit methane by belching (burping) or eructating (farting). Methane is also emitted by bacteria that can be found in human or animal faeces. Carbon dioxide and methane are emitted when detritivores/decomposers, like fungi or earthworms, decompose dead organic matter (e.g. twigs, leaves, animal parts, etc.) and turn it into soil. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Carbon sinks\n",
    "Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere, in the form of carbon dioxide, when they photosynthesize. The process during which plants absorb carbon dioxide, water and energy from the sun to produce oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds is denoted as photosynthesis. This process is performed by terrestrial, aquatic and ocean plants. Photosynthesis can only take place when sunlight is available. Therefore, plants do not photosynthesize during night. Instead, during nighttime, plants only respire (i.e. breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide). Plants store carbon in their tissue (biomass), when they use the energy-rich organic compounds, they produced during photosynthesis, to create new branches, leaves and roots or to expand the size of their trunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon enters the soil in the form of dead organic matter. All living organisms (e.g. plants, animals and humans) consist of organic matter. When plants drop their leaves or twigs on the ground, they drop organic matter. The same thing happens when humans and animals drop urin or faeces. In marine ecosystems, dead organic matter that has fallen down to the seabed, is turned into sediment. Carbon that is stored in soils can slowly be turned into oil and gas. However, this is a process that can take between 50,000,000 to 500,000,000 years to complete.\n",
