# ICOS Carbon Portal - Jupyter Notebooks
This repository contains code and ancillary data for all jupyter notebooks that are currently available through the ICOS CP "Anonymous" service: https://exploredata.icos-cp.eu

<br>

## Structure
The notebooks, code files and ancillary data files are divided into subjects. Every subject has its own folder:

* **Education:** includes notebooks that use ICOS data to introduce students to basic principles of climate science and programming 
* **ICOS Jupyter Notebooks:** contains notebooks processing and presenting ICOS data in interactive visualizations
* **Introduction:** contains notebooks that quickly introduce the fundamental principles of Python programming
* **Project-specific Jupyter Notebooks:** includes notebooks presenting the scientific output of projects ICOS has been part of
* **pylib_examples:** includes notebooks with examples on how to you the icoscp library (i.e. Python library on how to get access to ICOS data)
* **docs:** includes files for the online [ICOS Jupyter Solutions documentation](https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/).
* **exploredata:** includes folders with code to update the running instance of exploredata and format the corresponding log-in page.
