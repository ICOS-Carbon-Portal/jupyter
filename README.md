# ICOS Carbon Portal - Jupyter Notebooks
This folder contains code and ancillary data for all jupyter notebooks that are currently available through the 
ICOS CP "Anonymous" service: https://exploredata.icos-cp.eu.   
Documentation about the ICOS Carbon Portal Jupyter services is available at 
https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/.
<br>

## Structure
The folder includes subfolders with notebooks, documentation wikis and code files used to update docker images 

* **docker:** includes data files that are used to update a docker image which is, in turn, used to create a new Jupyter instance (i.e. exploredata) 
* **docs:** contains files for a documentation wiki, explaining ICOS Jupyter solutions and ICOS Jupyter notebooks.
* **notebooks:** includes notebooks that process and visualize ICOS data. The notebooks are divided into categories based on the intended target user groups.
