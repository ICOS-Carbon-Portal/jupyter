## Structure
The notebooks, code files and ancillary data files are divided into subjects. Every subject has its own folder:

* **Education:** includes notebooks that use ICOS data to introduce students to basic principles of climate science and programming 
* **ICOS Jupyter Notebooks:** contains notebooks processing and presenting ICOS data in interactive visualizations
* **Introduction:** contains notebooks that quickly introduce the fundamental principles of Python programming
* **Project-specific Jupyter Notebooks:** includes notebooks presenting the scientific output of projects ICOS has been part of
* **Pytools:** contains python libraries and modules for retrieving, processing and plotting ICOS data.
