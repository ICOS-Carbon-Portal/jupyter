<h3>About the Collaboration Server</h3>
<p>
    Our collaborative Jupyter Hub service is for <strong>registered users</strong> and offers advanced
    options like</p>

    <ul>
    <li>sharing notebooks and data</li>
    <li>uploading ancillary data for analysis together with ICOS data</li>
    <li>permanent storage of notebooks and data</li>
</ul>

<p>This service is continuously expanded in close consultation with
    our users and the ICOS community to support their scientific analysis and
    interpretation of ICOS data and products. All data and notebooks are "private", hence
    you can use this as a safe space to do research with unpublished data.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using our Jupyter Notebook Service to do research with ICOS
    data and elaborated products, but you don't have an account yet, please send your
    request to jupyter-info (at) icos-ri.eu .
