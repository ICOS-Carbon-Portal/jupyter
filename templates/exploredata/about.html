<h3>About Exploredata</h3>
<p>This is a service from the ICOS Carbon Portal to showcase how Python
Notebooks with Jupyter can be used to access the ICOS data products.
</p>

<p>Please visit <a
href="https://www.icos-cp.eu/data-services/tools/jupyter-notebook"
target="_blank">the Jupyter Notebook page on our website</a> to learn more about
our Exploredata service, view documentation, and <strong>apply for access</strong> to either this
service or our Collaboration server.
</p>

<p>Please be aware that this service is <strong>restricted</strong>. We allow
    only a limited amount of users to login and <strong>data is not
    persistent</strong>. After inactivity, you will be logged out automatically. If
    you want to save a file you have created/changed, you need to download the file
    to your computer.</p>

<p>The example notebooks available in Exploredata are all also publicly
available on <a href="https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/jupyter"
target="_blank">GitHub</a>, so you can also explore these notebooks on your own
computer. Our notebooks are organized into different folders:
</p>
