<h3>About Exploredata</h3>
<p>
    This is a service from the ICOS Carbon Portal to showcase how Python Notebooks
    with Jupyter can be used to access the ICOS data products. The <strong>password</strong>
    required to access this service is provided when you attend one of our <a href='https://www.icos-cp.eu/cp-webinar' target=_blank>webinars</a> or you can request it <a href='https://www.icos-cp.eu/data-services/tools/jupyter-notebook/exploredata-password' target=_blank>here</a>. Please read our <a href='https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/icos_notebooks/' target=_blank>documentation</a>. Once you login, you will find the following structure with examples to play with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> includes notebooks that use ICOS data to introduce students to basic principles of climate science and programming</li>
    <li><strong>ICOS Jupyter Notebooks:</strong> contains notebooks processing and presenting ICOS data in interactive visualizations</li>
    <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> contains notebooks that quickly introduce the fundamental principles of Python programming</li>
    <li><strong>Project-specific Jupyter Notebooks:</strong> includes notebooks presenting the scientific output of ICOS projects</li>
    <li><strong>pylib_examples:</strong> includes notebooks with examples on using our 'icoscp' python library to access ICOS data<br>Source: <a href='https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/pylib/' target=_blank>https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/pylib/</a><br>Documentation <a href='https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/pylib/' target=_blank>https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/pylib/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware, that this service is <strong>restricted</strong>. We allow only a limited amount of users to login and <strong>data is not persistent</strong>. After inactivity, you will be logged out automatically. If you want to save a file you have created/changed, you need to download the file to your computer.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using our Jupyter Notebook Service to do research with ICOS data and elaborated products, please apply for a <a href='https://www.icos-cp.eu/jupyter-personal-account-application' target=_blank>personal account</a>. Project folders (collaboration space) allow groups of users to have a shared space which is only visible to the members of the group. <a href='https://www.icos-cp.eu/jupyter-collaboration-space-application' target=_blank>Apply for collaborative space</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a general question, email us to jupyter-info (at) icos-ri.eu .</p>

<p>If you would like to explore the examples on your own computer, everything is publicly available on <a href='https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/jupyter' target=_blank>Github</a>. More information and documentation about our Jupyter Services can be found at <a href='https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/' target=_blank>https://icos-carbon-portal.github.io/jupyter/</a>.</p>
