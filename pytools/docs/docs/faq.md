## Nice to have
- attribute 'sampling height' for Dobj
- search for station by Name
- attribute 'license' for data object

## Known issues

- Stations are associated with the stationID. This means that at the moment a combined 
 station, certified for Ecosystem AND Atmosphere, has two different stationId's and hence to access ALL data for such a station you need provide a list of stationId's to find a complete set of data products.
 
	Example Norunda, Sweden (stationId "SE-Nor" for Ecosystem, stationId "NOR" for Atmosphere).
