        ## About ICOS
        
        The Integrated Carbon Observation System, ICOS, is a European-wide greenhouse gas research infrastructure. ICOS produces standardised data on greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as on carbon fluxes between the atmosphere, the earth and oceans. This information is being used by scientists as well as by decision makers in predicting and mitigating climate change. The high-quality and open ICOS data is based on the measurements from 134 stations across 12 European countries. For more information please visit [https://www.icos-cp.eu/](https://www.icos-cp.eu/)
        
        
        This package is under active development. Please be aware that changes to names of functions and classes are possible without further notice. Please do feedback any recommendations, issues, etc if you try it out.
        
        
        What is the package about?
        In essence this package allows you to have direct access to data objects from the ICOS CarbonPortal were a "Preview" is available. It is an easy access to data objects hosted at the ICOS Carbon Portal ( https://data.icos-cp.eu/ ). By using this library you can load data files directly into memory.
        
        
        We would encourage you to use a virtual environment for python to test this library.
        For example with mini-conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) you can create a new environment with:
        
        - `conda create -n icos python`
        - `activate icos`
        - `pip install icoscp`
