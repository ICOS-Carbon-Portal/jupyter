# ICOS Carbon Portal Python Package

## Access data from the Integrated Carbon Observation System, ICOS.


### This package is in development and can be considered "beta". Please be aware that changes to names of functions and classes are possible without further notice, but we try to be as consistent as possible. Please do feedback any recommendations, issues, etc if you try it out.

In essence this package allows you to have direct access to data objects from the ICOS CarbonPortal were a "Preview" is available. 

We would encourage you to use a virtual environment for python to test this library.
For example with mini-conda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) you can create a new environment with:

- `conda create -n icos python`
- `activate icos`
- `pip install icoscp`
